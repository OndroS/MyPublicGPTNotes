## Command: Write a code structure for a following chrome plugin: When user activates the plugin in extension panel, plugin will ask if user wants scarp data from displayed website. When user confirm, code will scrap all the data from displayed webpage, then use this data to feed OpenAI davinci model API returning summary and explanation of given webpage data in separate window.

\
Here is a general structure for a Chrome plugin that does the tasks described above:

```javascript
// Initialize the plugin and create a popup window to display the summary and explanation
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function() {
  // Create the popup window
  chrome.windows.create({
    url: "popup.html",
    type: "popup",
    width: 800,
    height: 600
  });

  // Listen for user activation of the plugin
  chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
    // Ask the user if they want to scrap data from the website
    if (confirm("Do you want to scrap data from the website?")) {
      // Scrap data from the website and feed it to the OpenAI model
      var data = scrapData();
      var summary = openai.summarize(data);
      var explanation = openai.explain(data);

      // Display the summary and explanation in the popup window
      displaySummary(summary);
      displayExplanation(explanation);
    }
  });
});
```

This code structure uses some functions and variables that are not defined in the code, such as scrapData, openai, displaySummary, and displayExplanation. These would need to be implemented in order for the plugin to work properly.




## Command: Define scrapData function


scrapData is a function that would be responsible for extracting data from the website that is currently displayed in the user's browser. Here is one way that this function could be implemented:

```javascript
function scrapData() {
  // Get the HTML of the website
  var html = document.documentElement.outerHTML;

  // Use a regular expression to extract the text from the HTML
  var text = html.match(/[^<>]+/g).join(" ");

  // Return the scraped data
  return text;
}
```

This implementation uses a regular expression to extract all the text from the HTML of the website, and then returns that text as the scraped data. This is just one possible way to implement the scrapData function, and other implementations may use different techniques for extracting data from the website.


## Command: Define openai function

openai is a variable that would be used to access the OpenAI API. This variable could be an object that contains functions for interacting with the API, such as a summarize function and an explain function. Here is an example of how the openai variable could be defined:

```javascript
var openai = {
  // Function for summarizing text using the OpenAI API
  summarize: function(text) {
    // Make a request to the OpenAI API to summarize the text
    var response = request("https://api.openai.com/v1/summarize", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        text: text,
        model: "davinci"
      })
    });

    // Return the summary from the API response
    return response.summary;
  },

  // Function for explaining text using the OpenAI API
  explain: function(text) {
    // Make a request to the OpenAI API to explain the text
    var response = request("https://api.openai.com/v1/explain", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        text: text,
        model: "davinci"
      })
    });

    // Return the explanation from the API response
    return response.explanation;
  }
};
```

This implementation of the openai variable contains two functions: summarize and explain. These functions make requests to the OpenAI API using the request function (which is not defined in this code) to summarize and explain the provided text, respectively. Note that in order for these functions to work properly, you will need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own API key from OpenAI.

## Command: Define displaySummary function

displaySummary is a function that would be used to display the summary of the scraped data in the popup window. Here is one way that this function could be implemented:

```javascript
function displaySummary(summary) {
  // Get the element in the popup window where the summary will be displayed
  var summaryElement = document.getElementById("summary");

  // Set the text of the element to the summary
  summaryElement.innerText = summary;
}
```
This implementation assumes that the HTML for the popup window includes an element with the ID summary, and that this element will be used to display the summary. The function simply gets a reference to this element and sets its text to the provided summary. Of course, this is just one possible way to implement the displaySummary function, and other implementations may use different techniques for displaying the summary in the popup window.

## Command: Write a minimum 1500 character long blog post selling this plugin and explaining the advantages and possibilities.
